# Trading-Bot

This was a summerproject to apply [Freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/) and create a trading bot in the cloud through telegram, docker and aws.
Furtermore, different trading strategies based on rsi and bollinger bands were applied and backtested on historical data.

Inspiration was found from [devbootstrap](https://github.com/devbootstrap/freqtrade-hyperopt-running-in-cloud-example).
